Question 1:
With the AVG energy of 0.659, AVG valence of 0.484, AVG danceability of 0.746, i would say the music
tends to be more positive, it is hard to tell which aura is matching, since it is more positive i would suggest 40% Purple 25 % Yellow 35% Orange
also from looking into the artists names and knowing many artists who are in the 'Rap' and 'Electronic Dance' genre so thats more of a rebellious type.

Question 2:
From checking out the AVG valence from single artists i think (since im not know whats the calculation behind the AVG function) is not so accurate.
By checking out the AVG valence from artist im knowing, i realised rap songs where the artist tend to be more aggressiv and negativ (6ix9ine, Juice WRLD, PostMalone, Drake)
it is most of the time abbove 0.5 even up to 0.75. Also Billie Eilish who seems to do more sad songs had an AVG from 0.534.
