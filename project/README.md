#### Description:

My final project is a website with six total HTML pages. In index.html, I created a front page that includes a background color, a simple navbar with links to Home, Contact, Todo-list, and Pomodoro Timer. A basic text (includes a user greeting after logging in) and a footer. The Navbar and Footer are also used on all the pages. I looked at some big tech companies for design inspiration and realized they keep things simple, so I decided to use bright and smooth colors.

I tried different designs and changed them multiple times but ended up sticking with a simple approach so the user wouldn’t be overwhelmed by the UI. Then, I started using containers to group text, footer, and so on, realizing it helped with organization. In contact.html, I implemented a moving background GIF, which was tricky to work with. At first, I had the whole landing page as the background video, but later I decided to make a small window with the video running in the background. I had trouble with the CSS code to position it correctly, including adjusting the width and height of the video. By changing the format to GIF and using the <img src=""> tag, I found a good solution and placement for the video running behind the submit form.

Speaking of the submit form, it took me several hours to figure out how to use it properly because I wanted to save the input to an external file. I realized the easiest way was to use a Google spreadsheet and create a script, then connect the API to the form. I thought about using an SQLite3 database as well, but using Flask with the Google form messed up my code, so I decided to stick with the spreadsheet and use SQLite3 for user registration.

The design of the submit form also took hours of trial and error. At one point, the footer got combined with the submit container since the submit form stretched to the end of the page. I had to figure out how to separate them, so I adjusted the container size of the submit form multiple times. I also used a checkbox design that I found online to make it look better but changed the color to match the website’s theme. The same goes for the submit button. Overall, I worked a lot with CSS here.

The register and login function wasn’t as easy as I expected. At first, I built a register function by myself and was very proud of it until realizing it wasn’t working. I couldn’t figure out how to debug the problem. Then, by using some parts of the register function from the finance project, things got better but weren’t fully solved. At one point, I was able to register and be logged in, but then the login function wasn’t working. I missed out on the autoincrement in the database, so there was no access to user_id and session. It was hard to find where the problem was. I checked all the HTML files and used a lot of print statements, which all worked fine, except the print(session) statement, which guided me to the solution. In the users.db, I used a table called users that saves the id, username, email, and hash.

I also find the flash function pretty useful to display a success action on the website, and that’s implemented in many different routes. Since I put so much work and time into the project, thinking I was finished, the overall result didn’t look as spectacular. So I decided to add a Todo-list and a Pomodoro timer since those two helped me while attending the CS50 class.

In the Todo-list page, I prompted the user to be logged in to use this service so the list is saved to the user, even if they log out. That is being saved in a table called tasks (users.db) as id, user_id, task, and completed, and it’s linked to the id of the user in the users table. Again, arranging the design, the spaces, and the placement in CSS was pretty painful, but finding a good solution was a big relief, the same as finding bugs in the code. The user can add, mark as completed, and delete their tasks, written in app.py. I didn’t use much code declaration since the names are pretty self-explanatory.

In Pomodoro, I implemented a simple timer, which gives the user the ability to choose between 25 minutes and 5- or 10-minute breaks. The tomato is drawn by myself as an experiment. I used an iPad and Procreate for it. With back.py, I removed the white background from the tomato, and with crop.py, I had to crop it since there was still some empty space around the tomato. The timer is written in JavaScript. I had to watch some videos and do research since I’m not that familiar with JS, but it was fun seeing and creating some interaction. I had issues with the alert being displayed to the user, so I tried to figure out different ways until finding that a sound and a notification worked best.

I also left some CSS in the HTML files. At first, I used the static page, but since the page was already so loaded from index and contact, I decided for my own purpose to use the <style> function inside the HTML. This way, I could get faster access to it without searching the whole CSS file for small changes. It’s probably not the correct way, but in this case, no one else gets access to the code, and it was the best way for myself.
